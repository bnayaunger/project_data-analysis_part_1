# project_data-analysis_part_1

This is the first part of a data analysis project that integrates web data extraction, preprocessing, and preparation for further exploration using machine learning.

## 📌 What’s in this part?

In this stage, we:
- Extracted real-estate data from a website (Web Scraping)
- Cleaned and processed the raw data
- Sorted and organized it into relevant fields
- Created a structured DataFrame ready for future analysis and modeling

## 📁 Files included

- `project_part_1.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all the code and steps
- `output_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset exported to CSV format

## 🧠 What's next?

In the upcoming stages of the project, we will perform in-depth data analysis, gain insights, and build machine learning models based on the processed dataset.
